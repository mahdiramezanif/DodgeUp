# DodgeUp
DodgeUp is a graphical game.
The objective is to control a dummy character at the bottom of the screen, avoiding collisions with incoming bricks
and collecting white blocks that appear randomly. 

## Features
- Dynamic gameplay: Bricks come from above in a random pattern, creating a unique challenge each time.
- Collectible white blocks: The player must collect white blocks while avoiding the bricks.
- Lives system: The dummy character has a certain number of lives, and hitting a brick reduces the number.
- Scoring: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of white blocks collected.
- Save each player's name and most points in the top players table

# Important feature
By means of a complex algorithm, the vertical and horizontal distance of both randomly generated blocks is controlled
so that the player always has an escape route.
